##### Project 1
Build a local note-taking app. The app should manage taking notes locally as a command-line tool. The app should store notes, retrieve them, print the notes, and search the notes. Work with your partners in teams of 2 people. Using Git for tracking changes is required.

###### Team 1 - Front End
Team 1 is focused on the user experience for the app. Features will be focused on the goal of a usable interface for the user.

- Develop a class or Python file to implement features related to a command-line interface for the user.
- For each feature, provide documentation for the user written in Markdown.
- The interface must process user input and provide help information to the user.
- Working with your partner, determine a list of features, and assign the features to be completed for each team member.
- Determine the minimum functionality required for a note-taking app.
- Communicate with the team developing the back-end functionality.

###### Team 2 - Back End
Team 2 is focused on the functionality and performance of the application. Features will be focused on the goal of efficient performance and extendable functionality.

- Develop a class or Python file to implement the functionality of the front-end features being used.
- Your class or Python file will determine an interface for Team 1. You must provide documentation for the developers in Team 1.
- The documentation should explain how to use your code and interface, and the format used for storage.
- Consider providing tests, although tests are optional for this assignment.
- Required Feature: Ability to search through the notes by either date or title.
- Working with your partner, determine a list of features and assign the features to be completed for each team member.
- Determine the minimum back-end functionality required for a note-taking app to be functional.
- Communicate with the team developing the front-end features.

##### Turn in:
- Required Python files
- Markdown documentation
- List of features, and the team members assigned
- The commit history of the main branch for your repository
- The names of your team members, and which team they were on

Potential features (frontend)
1. Create different files to contain notes
2. Each note taken should contain the date and time when it was created
3. Create different directories for different subjects, days, etc.
4. A files's contents should be searchable and results should print the corresponding note(s) and their date/time

stretch features:
1. specify filepath
2. Editing previous notes (Dr. Musgrave advises against this)
